# OUTLINE APPLICATION
Social media mobile application where friends post outlines of their days. 

## Software
Built using React Native and Firebase

## Version
0.1 (beta)

## Platform
iOS and Android (Mobile App)

## Branch Strategy
Essentially, we're gonna have a ticket for each feature and we branch based on that feature. Label them with ids. Work on the branch, make a pull request when finished, team will review it, then if approved it gets merged to main. NO ONE WORKS DIRECTLY ON MAIN, ONLY WORK ON THE FEATURE BRANCH.

## Code Review
Code reviews will be done weekly discussing the features added. Review pull requests for the week and give feedback on what is good and what can be improved. Whenever a feature is finished the team member will write a description on what was added.
