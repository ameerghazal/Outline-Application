# Potential Ideas (1/22/2024)
- Ibrahim: Project Portfollio Generator - Potential backup plan, maybe reggie.
- Ibrahim: Fit-gen, set quries utilzing a weather API for what to where. Potential is there, but far-fetched.
- Nirwaan & Ameer: Islamic Application (application, quran, etc).
- Airbus: DigitalInventory... For small business they usually do inventory on paper and we can make this digital by making an app. In the app, you have the picture, title, description, and where it's brought from. Each time an item is scanned it will subtract it from the digital Inventory app. You can set the threshold for a certain item so if it falls below that threshold it will go in the "Need Items" part in the app. You can track the quantity, store it's brought from, etc. Only issue is trying to figure out how to subtract the inventory if store are using stripe, toast, or other forms of terminals (maybe there is an API). 
- Nirwaan: Database-Warehouse, pulling from API or DB to filter if a place is halal certified (zabiha). Local map based off location to find zabiha spots.
- Ahmed: Application for Reverts. Teaches them salah, arabic, how to make wudu, basic islamic principles, faq, ...
- Nirwaan: Mini social media, with daily outline. Pre-set timings with reactions. This is similar to BeReal.
- AG: Vs-code extenstion time, space complexity tracker. Copy a part of the code, right click for the complexity analysis, with some tips to improve the code.
- Ibrahim: Language model creator; AI model exporter; give it speaking data, text messages, snap, ..., etc. Understands how the person talks and creates an A.I. model to export. 
- Nawaz: Course Scheduling Assistant; give pre-requsites, major reqs, electives, avaliability, with proffessor rating. For example, we could give it a time-table of how to gradute fast (e.g., I want to graduate in 2.5 years - if plausible). Class Nav data-scarping?
- Raza: if brand supports "Israel".
- Ibrahim: OU Parking Reporting.
- Nawaz: Lost and Found System.
