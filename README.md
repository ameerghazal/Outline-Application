# Potential Ideas (1/22/2024)
- Ibrahim: Project Portfollio Generator - Potential backup plan, maybe reggie.
- Ibrahim: Fit-gen, set quries utilzing a weather API for what to where. Potential is there, but far-fetched.
- Nirwaan & Ameer: Islamic Application (application, quran, etc).
- Airbus: DigitalInventory... For small business they usually do inventory on paper and we can make this digital by making an app. In the app, you have the picture, title, description, and where it's brought from. Each time an item is scanned it will subtract it from the digitalInventory app. You can set the threshold for a certain item so if it falls below that threshold it will go in the "Need Items" part in the app. You can track the quantity, store it's brought from, etc. Only issue is trying to figure out how to subtract the inventory if store are using stripe, toast, or other forms of terminals (maybe there is an API).
